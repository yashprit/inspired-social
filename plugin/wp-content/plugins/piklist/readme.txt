A Rapid Development Framework for WordPress.

== Description ==

**CURRENTLY IN BETA**

Piklist is the developers best friend. A rapid development framework for WordPress that will let you concentrate on the main focus of your plugin or theme, and let Piklist handle everything else.

[Watch the Piklist presentation from WordCamp NYC >](http://wordpress.tv/2012/09/04/steve-bruner-and-kevin-miller-building-powerful-websites-and-web-applications-with-piklist/):

= Piklist makes it easy to: =
*   Build Fields for Settings page, Widgets, Custom Post Types, Custom Taxonomies and User Profiles with minimal code.
*   Conditionally show fields (or their values), based on Post Status and/or User Role.
*   Define Custom Post Statuses
*   <a href="http://piklist.com">and more...</a>

= COMING SOON =
*   Drag-and-drop Field and Form builder.
*   Out-of-the-box applications: Contact Manager, Order Management, etc.

= LEARN MORE =
*   <a href="http://piklist.com/user-guide/">Piklist User Guide</a>

= Better Custom Post Types =
*   Powerful Custom Post Types 
*   Relate Custom Post Types to each other. 
*   Add your own post statuses. 

= Codeless Meta Boxes =
*   Group fields in a meta box, by placing them all in one file.
*   Add a comment block at the top of your file to define the meta box attributes 
*   Hide/Show based on the post status. 
*   Hide/Show based on the users capability. 
*   Sort meta boxes with granular control. 
*   Lock the box, so users cannot move or hide them.
*   Add meta box to a specific Page/Post ID.

= Simple, Groupable Widgets =
*   Group widgets into one widget to save space, and make finding them easier 
*   Create one file for your Widget settings, and one for your output... all done!
*   Use any Piklist field type in your widget settings page.

= Powerful Fields =
*   Backend, Frontend, Widgets... it all works the same.

= Lots of field types (and more coming soon!): =
*   text
*   textarea
*   checkbox
*   radio
*   select
*   post editor
*   hidden
*   html
*   date chooser 
*   color picker
*   add more

= Choose a content type for your field (You can even mix-n-match on one form) =
*   post
*   post_meta
*   comment
*   comment_meta
*   term
*   term_meta
*   user
*   user_meta
*   media
*   media_meta

= Mix Field and Content types (i.e. Taxonomies as radio buttons) =
*   Hide/Show based on another form field. 
*   Hide/Show based on the post status.
*   Hide/Show based on the users capability.
*   Hide form fields, and just show field values
