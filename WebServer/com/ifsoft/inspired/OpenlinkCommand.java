/**
 * An Openlink command is a stateless object responsbile for executing the
 * provided service. Each subclass will only have one instance that will be
 * shared across all users sessions. Therefore, it is important to not keep any
 * information related to executions as permanent data (i.e. as instance or
 * static variables). Each command has a <tt>code</tt> that should be unique
 * within a given JID.
 * <p>
 *
 * Commands may have zero or more stages. Each stage is usually used for
 * gathering information required for the command execution. Users are able to
 * move forward or backward across the different stages. Commands may not be
 * cancelled while they are beig executed. However, users may request the
 * "cancel" action when submiting a stage response indicating that the command
 * execution should be aborted. Thus, releasing any collected information.
 * Commands that require user interaction (i.e. have more than one stage) will
 * have to provide the data forms the user must complete in each stage and the
 * allowed actions the user might perform during each stage (e.g. go to the
 * previous stage or go to the next stage).
